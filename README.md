# Lending Club Case Study

- Lending Club, a consumer finance marketplace specializing in offering a variety of loans to urban customers.
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
- Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
    - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The data contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. 
- The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## General Information

### Objectives

- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- This case study aims to achieve this goal through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the provided [Dataset](./loan/loan.csv)
